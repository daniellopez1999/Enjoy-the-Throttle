# Enjoy-the-Throttle

## Description  
Enjoy the Throttle is mainly done to join/create groups where you can talk with other Bikers in a Live Chat build with Socket.io to live chat and Express to save and load previous messages. 
You can also meet people in groups of specific bikes, in case that you want to talk only about an specific model.

You can fetch from all the bikes from [Motorcycles API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/motorcycles) to register and create specific groups where you can join only if you have the mandatory selected bike.
